Barcode4j-core
==============

This is a fork of Barcode4j (http://barcode4j.sourceforge.net/) with removed dependencies and focus on the core functionality. All dependencies to other liberaries (avalon, commons-cli, etc.) were removed. Its currently set to be build against Java 11, but it will probably work with java 8 as well. It's also OSGI-ready!

We at cjt use it as replacement for the default barcode4j implementation in combination with jasperreports.
